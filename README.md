## Abstract
Beamer ([https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home](https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home)) is a LaTeX class that allows you to create
presentations. Beamer contains several full-featured (but a bit ugly) themes, so I wrote this spiffy theme (but with some missing features) called Roma.

The color scheme is taken from the official Sapienza [brand guidelines](http://www.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/ElementiBase_Brand%20acrhitecture.pdf).
